Compiling a list of all places I have tried a flat white in Paris, with the goal to eventually have an API to find the closest one to me/you :)

Current ratings are available [**in this .json**](https://github.com/nlml/decent-flat-white-coffee-in-paris/blob/main/src/ratings.json)

## Ratings guide

Ratings are out of 5.

**5.0** indicates a perfect flat white with specialty beans and interesting flavour.

**4.0** is a decent flat white, on par with what you would get from any decent coffee place in Australia.

**3.0** is an ok flat white, probably what you would more call a latte, and probably about on par with what you would make at home or a little better.

**2.0** is something about on par with what you would get out of those capsule coffee machines, with UHT milk or something for extra badness.

**1.0** is on par with instant coffee or something you would get for 50 cents out of a service station coffee machine.

## Contributing

Feel free to submit a pull request with a location and rating. I will try the flat white there to confirm your rating. Perhaps in the future I will allow contributions without me personally trying the flat white first.

You are welcome to contribute coffees that are not called Flat White in the shop (e.g. a Latte). Just set your rating as if it were a flat white you were going for.
